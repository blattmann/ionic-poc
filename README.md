# Ionic POC

## Project setup

Install the Ionic CLI with npm:

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

```
npm uninstall -g ionic
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```
